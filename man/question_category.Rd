\description{
Creates a \code{question_category} object.

\details{
Defines a category of questions to be included in the \emph{Moodle} question bank.

It allows us to define the name of the category, the copyright and license
literals that will be added to each question, and the feedback literals for
correct, partially correct and incorrect questions.

Each question can include an image after the text. We can also configure if
we want to automatically transform the images so that they have a standard
size that we can also indicate.
