## Installation

You can install the development version of moodef from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("josesamos/moodef")
```

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(moodef)
## basic example code
```

``` r
# summary(cars)
```

up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
